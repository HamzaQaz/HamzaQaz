I'm a 15-year-old full‑stack developer who loves turning ideas into working apps. I build frontends with React, ship backends with Node/Express, and tinker with databases (Postgres/MongoDB). I care about clean, readable code, tests that actually catch bugs, and automating boring stuff with scripts and CI. I post projects here — web apps, bots, and small libraries — and I’m always learning, collaborating, and open to mentorship. Check my repos and open an issue or PR to say hi.
